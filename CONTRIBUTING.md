Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small!

## Development workflow

This project is a monorepo managed using NPM. It contains the following packages:

- The library package in the root directory.
- An example app in the `example/` directory.

To get started with the project, run `npm` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
npm i
```

The [example app](/example/) demonstrates usage of the library. You need to run it to test any changes you make.

It is configured to use the local version of the library, so any changes you make to the library's source code will be reflected in the example app. Changes to the library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild, but native code changes will require a rebuild of the example app.

You can use various commands from the root directory to work with the project.

To start the packager:

```sh
npx expo start --clear
```
